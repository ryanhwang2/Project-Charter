relevant IT career knowledge, discover key resources, begin lasting 
professional relationships, and document them in them within a personal 
website of my own creation. It solves the issue of me having no initial 
work experience or preparation for the IT industry, by delivering : 1) 
CompTIA A+ Certification; 2) personal website coded in HTML documenting 
my findings and relevance for other students; 3) database of 
professional network and contacts and relevant insights; 4) a report on 
specific utilized resources and relevance to beginning IT candidates; 
and 5) an interactive activity to summarize knowledge and apply 
knowledge gained. Myself and other students will benefit from this, 
since this will provide key insights and real hands-on understanding of 
current status of the IT industry we will enter.&nbsp;</p></div>

                        <h4>Personal Mission Connection:</h4>
                        <p>[My personal mission, as of now, is to obtain
 my first work experience and succeed at that work. This project 
connects to that mission, because it reflects and hones values necessary
 to obtain and succeed at that work, such as: 1) Diligence; 2) 
Organization; 3) Proactivity; and 4) Thoughtfulness. This project 
requires diligence to ensure all the steps are met within specific 
constraints presented, as would be the case in work. This project 
requires organization to ensure clear understanding of objectives and no
 unnecessary confusion and waste of resources, as would be the case in 
work. It also requires proactivity to ensure timeliness and compliance 
with any and all existing standards and addressing of unexpected issues,
 as would be done at work. Finally, it requires thoughtfulness to ensure
 that it is original, valuable beyond its basic presentation and 
content, and something that is authentically me or representative of my 
personal thoughts and ideas, as would be the case in work.&nbsp;</p>
                        
                        <h4>Vision Alignment:</h4>
                        <p>[My vision is to become a respected leader in
 data management and enterprise resource planning known for my 
adaptable, scalable, and effective solutions, as well as emphasis on 
excellent relationships with clients and customers and being current 
with latest systems developments. This project will help me to achieve 
that by serving as an initial front-door entryway to establish a strong 
foothold in my vision's required areas of: 1) professional outreach and 
communications; 2) technical understanding; 3) technical application and
 problem-solving; and 4) technical skills and knowledge enhancement. ]</p>
                        
                        <h4>Strategic Goal Support:</h4>
                        <p>[This connects to the Strengths section of the SWOT, and can help me 
accomplish my vision by ensuring that my work will be quality and 
adaptable. This is because through developing those skills, I will have 
gained considerable knowledge of how it is done and from there, I can 
expand upon areas that may need further development or revisions. By 
doing this, I will also become able to scale up or scale down 
operations, and change as needed when faced with new or different 
contexts. Additionally, this&nbsp;connects to the Opportunities section of the SWOT, and can help me 
accomplish my vision by forming strategic relationships and gain 
industry intelligence. From this, I will be kept in the loop on news and
 developments in the industry, as well as enriching knowledge of current
 systems. Additionally, my reputation will also be bolstered, helping me
 to eventually reach and accomplish leadership roles and goals in data 
management and enterprise resource planning. Finally, this connects to the Weaknesses section of the SWOT, and can help me 
accomplish my vision by ensuring I meet and fulfill industry 
expectations of me within data management. By doing this, I will also 
increase chances of me beginning my journey with a strong and positive 
impact. It will also make me a more endearing candidate to hire, thus 
helping me to build myself up.]</p>

portfolio enhancement (I previously had no portfolio), as well as an 
applicable project to demonstrate my skills and aptitude for my resume 
and work letters. Additionally, I will unlock networking opportunities 
by first establishing key relationships with experienced people in the 
industry, wherein mentoring opportunities and chances for professional 
growth can be more easily pursued. Additionally, I will have gained a 
working professional certificate - CompTIA A+ - that will not have to be
 renewed for a few years, and demonstrates that I have met the base 
standards of knowledge to have within the industry. ]</p>

 career choices, recommended training, and companies to look out for. 
Additionally, I will gain project management experience and training, 
since this entire project is centered around such. Furthermore, I will 
improve on my technical skills, since I have to create a viewable and 
professional database, a fully functional and interactable website with 
HTML, and a report on what resources I used and their value. ]</p>
